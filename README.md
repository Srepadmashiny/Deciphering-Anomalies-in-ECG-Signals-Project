# Project Description
In my project I have utilized multivariate anomaly detection using the histogram based outlier detection. The terms of significance have been explained below:
**Anomaly Detection :** Anomaly detection is a technique that identifies abnormal patterns or outliers within a dataset. In the context of this project, it is used to detect irregularities in ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals, which can indicate potential health issues.
**Multivariate Anomaly Detection :** Multivariate anomaly detection is a method that assesses anomalies by considering multiple variables simultaneously, making it suitable for complex datasets with interconnected features. In this project, it has been applied to ECG signals for enhanced accuracy.
**Python PyOD Library :** Python PyOD is a relatively new Python library introduced approximately three years ago, specifically designed for anomaly detection tasks. It offers a wide range of techniques and algorithms to identify outliers in various data domains.
This project makes use of Python PyOD to implement multivariate anomaly detection in ECG signals. One notable advantage of PyOD is its versatility, making it a valuable resource for researchers and developers in the anomaly detection field.
**Histogram-Based Outlier Detection:** The project employs histogram-based outlier detection as a core technique. This method is favored for its effectiveness in identifying anomalies in ECG data. By utilizing histograms, it can capture irregular patterns and fluctuations within the signals, contributing to the accuracy of anomaly detection.

The primary goal of this project is to not only detect anomalies in ECG signals but also predict the type of disease or health condition associated with these anomalies. The presence or absence of one anomaly is considered independently from other anomalies, ensuring that all potential issues are thoroughly assessed. This project holds promise in improving healthcare diagnostics by automating the process of detecting abnormalities in ECG signals and providing valuable insights into potential health conditions.
